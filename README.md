# Dynamic DNS Domains (domain-list.txt)
This list was pulled from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/jedisct1/ed2af95311b104f94874a730d48d9b45)

# Subdomains (subdomain-list.txt)
This is just an example list for getting you up and running. A better list would be a list of subdomains from [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Discovery/DNS) or even better a list of usernames from a customer you are evaluating.
